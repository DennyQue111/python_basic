# while loop = a statement that will execute it's block of code, as long as it's condition remains true
# for loop = a statement that will execute it's block of code; a limited amount of times
# for i in range(50,100+1,2):       2 means incremental number;

# nested loops = The

# loop control statements = change a loops execution from its normal sequence
# break = used to terminate the loop entirely
# continue = skips to the ext iteration of the loop;
# pass = does nothing, acts as a placeholder
# 2D list =  a list of lists;
# set = collection which is unordered, unindexed. No duplicate values

# list = used to store multiple items in a single variable
# tuple = collection which is ordered and unchangeable
          #used to group together related data
# dictionary = A changeable, unordered collection of unique key:value pairs
#              Fast because they use hashing, allow us to access a value quickly

# index operator [] = gives access to a sequence's element (str,list,tuples)
# function =  a block of code which is executed only when it is called.
# return statement = functions send python values/objects back to the caller
#                    These values/objects are known as the function's return value;

# nested functions calls = function calls inside other function calls
#                          innermost function calls are resolved first
#                          returned value is used as argument for the next outer function

# scope = The region that a variable is recognized
#         A variable is only available from inside the region it is created.
#         A global and locally scoped versions of a variable can be created
# LEGB rule : Local Enclosing Global Built-in

# *args = parameter that will pack all arguments into a tuple
#         useful so that a function can accept a varying amount of arguments
# **kwargs = parameter that will pack all arguments into a dictionary
#            useful so that a function can accept a varying amount for keyword arguments

# str.format() = optional method that gives users more control when displaying output

# exception = events detected during execution that interrupt the flow of the program;

# copyfile() = copies contents of a file
# copy() =     copyfile() + permission mode + destination can be a directory
# copy2() =    copy() + copies metadata (file's creation and modification times)
